# Tempmon
A simple application to provide temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure information\
using a BME280 sensor (I use it with a Raspberry Pi) with live data and a 48 hour history graph.

#
This app is currently NOT designed to use multiple sensors but I may add this functionality later.\
(When my lazy self sets up and outdoor sensor) For now it uses outdoor data from OpenWeatherMap.
